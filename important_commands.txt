# Execute ad-hoc commands without writing a playbook. For example, to ping all hosts: ansible all -i inventory_file -m ping
# To gather system information (facts) from hosts: ansible all -i inventory_file -m setup
# To check the connectivity to all hosts: ansible all -i inventory_file -m ping
# Run a specific module on a specific host or group: ansible webservers -i inventory_file -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
# To run a playbook with extra variables: ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml -e "variable_name=value"
# To run a playbook only on specific hosts: ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml --limit host1
# To simulate a playbook run without making changes: ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml --check
# To increase the verbosity of output for debugging:
	: ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml -v  # Use -vv or -vvv for more verbosity

## To run playbooks in the background without blocking your terminal: nohup ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml &
